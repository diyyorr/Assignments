My hardest challenge was realizing that after writing and closing the file, reopening it resets the file pointer to the beginning.
I expected it to keep writing at the end, because the file descriptor was there but it didnâ€™t. I had to use sys_lseek to move the file descriptor to the end before writing again, otherwise it would overwrite the original quotes.
